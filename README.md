Tested only 6x6 Multiplayer and Warzone. Everything else besides raids or coop is probably working (unless Activision break it themselves). Crashing if no game is present is a known issue, im not really a js coder so idk how to fix it lmao\

Installation:
1. Install NodeJS (any version will do probably)
2. clone the repo
3. cd into it
4. run `npm i`
5. change your profile link in `SteamRPC.js` and folder path in `RUN.bat`
6. make a shortcut of `RUN.bat`
7. WIN+R and type `shell:startup`
8. throw a shortcut here
9. test
